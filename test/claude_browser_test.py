        Check if Hawksmoor Air Street in London has availability tomorrow night for 2 people.

        Steps:
        1. Search for "Hawksmoor Air Street London reservation"
        2. Find their booking page (likely OpenTable or their own reservation system)
        3. Check availability for tomorrow at 7:30pm for 2 people
        4. Record ALL available time slots for tomorrow evening
        5. Get the DIRECT BOOKING LINK that would allow someone to make a reservation
        6. Note the price range if visible
        7. Check if there are any special offers or deals available

        Important: 
        - Make sure to find and include the EXACT BOOKING URL in your response
        - The response should be formatted for a chat conversation with a customer
        - Make sure to offer to book the reservation directly for the customer
        - Be casual and friendly, like you're texting a friend
